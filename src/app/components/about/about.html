                        I explore opportunities to bridge the gap between cutting-edge Large Language Models and
                        practical, user-centric applications.

                    <p>
                        With a background in computer science and a passion for NLP, I build systems that not only
                        understand text but also take action. From creating user friendly interfaces to optimising
                        backend infrastructure, I focus on creating AI applications that adds real value.

                        I like to keep my services local and independent, so much so that I built a custom home server
                        powered by dual NVIDIA V100s, providing a dedicated environment to fine tune models and test
                        infrastructure at scale.

                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, I keep myself updated with the latest IT industry news, or just relaxing
                        with a good TV show.
