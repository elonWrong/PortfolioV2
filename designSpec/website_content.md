## About Section
**Title:** About Me

**Content:**
I explore opportunities to bridge the gap between cutting-edge Large Language Models and practical, user-centric applications.

With a background in computer science and a passion for NLP, I build systems that not only understand text but also take action. From creating user friendly interfaces to optimising backend infrastructure, I focus on creating AI applications that adds real value.

I like to keep my services local and independent, so much so that I built a custom home server powered by dual NVIDIA V100s, providing a dedicated environment to fine tune models and test infrastructure at scale.

When I'm not coding, I keep myself updated with the latest IT industry news, or just relaxing with a good TV show.
