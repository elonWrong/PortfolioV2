## About Section
**Title:** About Me

**Content:**
I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge Large Language Models and practical, user-centric applications.

With a background in computer science and a passion for NLP, I build systems that not only understand text but also take action. From fine-tuning open-source models to orchestrating complex agentic workflows, I focus on creating AI that adds real value.

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the latest research papers or optimizing my local LLM inference stack on my dual V100 system.
